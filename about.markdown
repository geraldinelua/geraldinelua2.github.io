Geraldine Lua is an Illustrator and Graphic Designer living in Sussex County, New Jersey. She attended the County College of Morris in Randolph, NJ where she received her Associate's Degree in Graphic Design in 2021. Geraldine plans to continue her education and obtain her BFA in Graphic Design at Kean University in Union, NJ.

Previously, Geraldine worked as a Dental Hygienist, but her desire to pursue the arts and fuel her creative side drove her to return to school and pursue a different degree.

If she's not busy with school, Geraldine spends a lot of time making illustrations on her Wacom tablet. Her illustrations would be categorized as "cute" or "kawaii", and can also be under "children's illustrations".

Geraldine prides herself with her small stationery shop, Geraldine Draws (https://geraldinedraws.com), where she turns her illustrations into stickers, art prints, and other stationery goods. She hopes to gain more exposure and create a wider variety of merchandise, all based around her drawings.

Currently, her interests in Graphic Design lean toward UI / UX design as well as marketing and advertising.
